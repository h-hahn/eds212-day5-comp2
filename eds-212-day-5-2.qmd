## Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)

-   != (do these NOT match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   &, \|

```{r}
# does 4 = 5?
4 == 5

# does 4 = 4?
4 == 4

# does 4 not equal 5?
4 != 5

# with assigned variables
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog 

# dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20
dog > cat | cat < 20

# dog greater than cat, AND is cat = 10
dog > cat & cat == 10


```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "lightblue3") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "CARS", x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per Gallon")
```
